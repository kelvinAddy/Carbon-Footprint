# Carbon Footprint Calculator 🌍

A desktop application that estimates carbon emissions from oilfield drilling projects. Built with PyQt6, this tool enables users to calculate, visualize, and mitigate Scope 1–3 emissions with a user-friendly interface. It integrates the OpenAI GPT API for generating actionable reduction plans and uses Matplotlib for dynamic plotting of emission trends and net-zero targets.

## 🔍 Features

Scope 1, 2, and 3 Emissions Input – Enter detailed fuel and flaring data for different drilling systems.

Real-Time Visualization – Bar charts showing current emissions and projected net-zero paths using Matplotlib.

GPT Integration – Automatically generate strategic net-zero mitigation plans via OpenAI’s GPT API.

Drill-Specific Metrics – Customize inputs for circulatory, hoisting, rotary, and flaring systems.

Net-Zero Timeline – Interactive chart showing how emissions decline over time with applied strategies.
